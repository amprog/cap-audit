Whenever a page or post is deleted, we want to know who deleted it and when. CAP-Audit is designed to track that.

Every time a page is edited in any way, this plugin tracks the page ID, the user ID, the user's IP address, and a timestamp for when it happened. Then, it puts it in a table called audit_wp_pages.
